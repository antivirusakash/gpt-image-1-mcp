# What is gpt-image-1 MCP?

gpt-image-1 MCP is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that provides AI-powered image generation capabilities using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 model. It serves as a bridge between OpenAI's advanced image generation technology and MCP-compatible applications.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables AI assistants to work with external tools and data sources. It allows you to extend the capabilities of AI models by connecting them to specialized services, databases, and tools.

## Key Features

### üé® Advanced Image Generation

- **gpt-image-1 Integration**: Generate high-quality images using OpenAI's latest image generation model
- **Superior Text Rendering**: Crisp, legible typography and logos in generated images
- **Native Transparency**: Built-in transparent background support without post-processing
- **Multiple Formats**: PNG, JPEG, and WebP output with optimized compression

### üèóÔ∏è Flexible Dimensions

- **Square Format**: 1024√ó1024 for avatars, icons, and social media
- **Landscape Format**: 1536√ó1024 for headers, banners, and presentations
- **Portrait Format**: 1024√ó1536 for mobile screens and posters
- **Quality Options**: Choose between standard and HD quality levels

### üéØ English-Optimized

- **English-Only Input**: Optimized for English prompts to maximize gpt-image-1 performance
- **Input Validation**: Automatic validation with helpful error messages
- **LLM Integration**: Designed to work with your LLM for translation when needed
- **Superior Results**: Leverages gpt-image-1's GPT-4o language understanding

### üõ†Ô∏è Image Editing

- **AI-Powered Editing**: Modify and enhance generated images
- **Multiple Edit Types**: Inpainting, outpainting, style transfer, and background changes
- **Batch Processing**: Apply the same edit to multiple images efficiently
- **Seamless Workflow**: Integrate editing into your image generation pipeline

## How It Works

1. **Connect**: Your MCP client connects to the gpt-image-1 MCP server
2. **Generate**: Use the `generate-image` tool to create images with English prompts
3. **Edit**: Enhance images with the `edit-image` tool
4. **Optimize**: Leverage MCP-optimized responses for efficient workflows
