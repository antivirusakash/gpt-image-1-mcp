# Documentation Update Implementation Plan
# Created: 2025-07-15 04:20:00
# Context: Major image generation model changes require documentation updates and asset regeneration

project_context:
  name: "GPT Image 1 MCP Server Documentation Update"
  description: "Comprehensive documentation refresh due to image generation model changes"
  status: "planning"

validation_criteria:

  content_accuracy:
    - All documented features must be actually implemented
    - All examples must be tested and working
    - No placeholder or "coming soon" features in main docs
    - Clear separation of experimental features
    
  visual_consistency:
    - All images use consistent style and quality
    - Professional appearance across all assets
    - Responsive design compatibility
    - Accessibility compliance
    
  user_experience:
    - New users can successfully complete getting started guide
    - Examples work without modification
    - Clear indication of what requires API keys
    - Troubleshooting covers common real issues

success_metrics:
  - Documentation reflects actual implementation (100% accuracy)
  - All assets generated with new model for consistency
  - User can complete full workflow from docs alone
  - No confusion about implemented vs planned features
  - Professional appearance matching current AI tool standards

notes:
  implementation_gaps_to_address:
    - edit-image, create-variation, batch-edit tools are placeholders
    - Should be clearly marked as "planned" not "available"
    - Provide timeline for actual implementation
    - Suggest workarounds using available tools
    
  asset_generation_priority:
    1. Hero image (most visible)
    2. Feature demonstration images
    3. Tutorial step-by-step images
    4. Section icons and navigation elements
    5. Advanced example screenshots
    
  maintenance_plan:
    - Update docs immediately when features are implemented
    - Regular audit of accuracy vs implementation
    - User feedback integration process
    - Automated testing of documentation examples
