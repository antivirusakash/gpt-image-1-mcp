# Critical Issues Discovered
critical_issues:
  - issue_id: "RESP_SIZE_001"
    severity: "HIGH"
    title: "Response Size Exceeds MCP Token Limits"
    description: |
      Generated images in base64 format create responses >1.5M tokens, 
      far exceeding MCP's 25K token limit. This makes the service 
      unusable for image generation despite successful API calls.
    affected_functions: ["generate-image"]
    reproduction_steps:
      - "Call generate-image with any prompt"
      - "Image generates successfully on server side"
      - "Response fails to return due to token limit"
    recommended_fixes:
      - priority: "IMMEDIATE"
        solution: "Implement response chunking or streaming"
      - priority: "HIGH"
        solution: "Return only metadata + file path instead of base64"
      - priority: "MEDIUM"
        solution: "Add response_format parameter to choose URL vs base64"

# Medium Priority Issues
medium_issues:
  - issue_id: "LOCAL_FILE_001"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    title: "analyze-image Cannot Process Local Files"
    description: |
      The analyze-image function only accepts web URLs, preventing 
      analysis of locally generated images. This breaks the expected 
      workflow of generate → analyze.
    affected_functions: ["analyze-image"]
    recommended_fixes:
      - priority: "HIGH"
        solution: "Convert local files to data URLs before API call"
      - priority: "MEDIUM"
        solution: "Implement temporary web server for local file access"

# Successfully Fixed Issues (During Testing)
resolved_issues:
  - issue_id: "STYLE_PARAM_001"
    title: "gpt-image-1 Style Parameter Incompatibility"
    description: "API was sending unsupported 'style' parameter to gpt-image-1"
    fix_applied: "Removed style parameter from API calls and MCP schema"
    status: "RESOLVED"

  - issue_id: "ASPECT_RATIO_001"
    title: "Incorrect Aspect Ratio Size Mapping"
    description: "Using DALL-E 3 sizes instead of gpt-image-1 supported sizes"
    fix_applied: "Updated mapping to use 1536x1024 and 1024x1536"
    status: "RESOLVED"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate_actions:
    - "Implement response optimization for generate-image function"
    - "Add file-to-data-URL conversion for analyze-image function"
  
  short_term_improvements:
    - "Add response format options (metadata-only, chunked, streaming)"
    - "Implement local file serving capability"
    - "Add comprehensive error handling for oversized responses"
  
  long_term_enhancements:
    - "Consider implementing image compression options"
    - "Add caching mechanism for generated images"
    - "Implement progress callbacks for large operations"

# Test Environment
environment:
  os: "Linux 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2"
  platform: "linux"
  node_version: "v20+"
  openai_client_version: "^4.0.0"
  mcp_sdk_version: "^0.5.0"

# Next Steps
next_steps:
  - "Address critical response size issue"
  - "Implement local file support for analyze-image"
  - "Conduct full regression testing after fixes"
  - "Document API limitations and workarounds"

# Notes
notes: |
  Despite the response size issues, the core functionality is working correctly.
  The OpenAI gpt-image-1 integration is successful, and all validation systems
  are functioning as expected. The main issues are infrastructure-related 
  rather than functional problems.
